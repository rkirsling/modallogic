Modal Logic Playground
======================

A graphical semantic calculator for modal propositional logic, built using [D3](http://d3js.org/), [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/), and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

See it in action at [rkirsling.github.com/modallogic](http://rkirsling.github.com/modallogic/)!

### Reusable code
* The core part of the code is MPL.js, a library for parsing and evaluating well-formed formulas of modal propositional logic. See the API Reference [here](API-Reference.md).
* I've also extracted the directed graph editing code so that it can be easily repurposed. You can find it [here](http://bl.ocks.org/rkirsling/5001347).
